      <h1>A Short Story Summary</h1>
      <h3>Touching Spirit Bear</h3>
     
    <p>This book was a requirement in one of my English classes in middle school and the story has alwasy stuck with me.</p>
    <p>Cole Mathews is a 15 year old boy in this story. This boy hurt another boy in a fight and is sentenced to Circle Justice, this is a program for juvenile offenders. 
        In this Tlingit healing program they are sentenced to an Alaskan island to change their ways. Throughout this story Cole is faced with the brutal Alaskan elements. 
        He learns to help others, heal his own emotional wounds, and take responsibility for his actions that have hurt other people.
